    mkdir /tmp/cgroupfs
    ./cgroupfs /tmp/cgroupfs /docker/$container_id

    ## Go to the first tab
    docker start $container_id

    ## Take a look at /tmp/cgroupfs/meminfo now
    ## cgroupfs file system should be able to show the memory usage of the container
    root@linux-dev:/home/vagrant# cat /tmp/cgroupfs/meminfo

    ## Enter docker container, you should see free is showing the real usage
    docker exec -it $container_id bash
    root@251d4d18bca6:/# free -m
